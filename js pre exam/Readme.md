Just built a Minimal Note App using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript – no libraries, no frameworks, no JSON, and absolutely no onclick in HTML. Pure DOM-based, clean OOP logic 💻✨

🗒️ Features:

✅ Add notes with Title & Description

✅ Neat, responsive UI

✅ All notes stored in localStorage (data stays even after refresh)

✅ Built using DOM methods + OOP style, keeping logic modular & maintainable

✅ Clean separation of HTML & JavaScript 💡

🧠 How It Works:

1.Stores notes like this: "Title%%Description"

2.Splits notes at "%%" to show both parts

3.Adds and deletes using event listeners only

4.Clean separation between HTML and JS (DOM OOP style)
